In this repository I uploaded multiple mini projects that I have done during my CodSoft Internship of Java Programming
# GuessMyNumber (Task_11)
Key Features:

1. Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within a defined range, which the user needs to guess.

2. User Input Handling: The program takes user input to guess the number and provides feedback, guiding the user toward the correct answer.

3. Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the user receives feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.

4. Looping Structure: The game is designed with a looping structure to allow the user multiple attempts until the correct number is guessed.

5. Range Configuration: The project allows for customization of the range of numbers to be guessed, enhancing the flexibility of the game.

# Student Grade Calculator (Task_2)
Key Features:

1. Input Collection: Enables users to input students' marks conveniently via a console interface, ensuring ease of data entry.

2. Percentage Calculation: Accurately computes the percentage for each student based on their total marks and the maximum possible marks, providing precise evaluation.
   
3. Decimal Formatting: Utilizes the DecimalFormat method to ensure precision in displaying decimal values, providing accurate representation of percentages and other numerical data in the output.

4. Grade Determination: Automatically assigns grades to students based on predefined percentage ranges, facilitating quick and meaningful performance categorization.

5. Output Presentation: Presents students' result sheets in a structured format, displaying subject-wise marks, total marks, percentage, and assigned grade for easy interpretation.

6. Dynamic Grading Criteria: Allows flexible adjustment of grade ranges to accommodate various grading policies or educational standards, ensuring adaptability and scalability.
