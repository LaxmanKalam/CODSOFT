In this repository I uploaded multiple mini projects that I have done during my CodSoft Internship of Java Programming
# GuessMyNumber (Task_01)
Key Features:

1. Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within a defined range, which the user needs to guess.

2. User Input Handling: The program takes user input to guess the number and provides feedback, guiding the user toward the correct answer.

3. Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the user receives feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.

4. Looping Structure: The game is designed with a looping structure to allow the user multiple attempts until the correct number is guessed.

5. Range Configuration: The project allows for customization of the range of numbers to be guessed, enhancing the flexibility of the game.
